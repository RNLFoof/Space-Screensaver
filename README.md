# Space-Screensaver
Little guy I made to match the color of the bulb in my room. Color of the comets and stuff is based on color.txt.
Made with Game Maker 8.1 purely because it was the only thing I could get to launch as a screensaver (did you know screensavers are just regular executables? and the "close when the mouse moves" functionality is built into each one manually? I thought that was really funny).

Then I found out that Windows doesn't consider you idle unless your CPU usage is low enough. I run servers on my main computer like a dumbass, so it's basically never low enough, so now it's made with ancient garbage software for no reason.

Versioning done with https://github.com/Medo42/Gmk-Splitter.
